PullToReach is a simple drag-and-drop solution for implementing the pull-to-reach functionality seen in the music app [Soor](http://soor.app) by [Tanmay](https://twitter.com/tanmays). This allows your users with big phones to reach the content on the top of the display easily.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting started

Getting started is as easy as conforming your ViewController to the `PullToReach` protocol and activating the functionality by calling the `activatePullToReach` function.

```swift
class TeamMembersViewController: UITableViewController, PullToReach {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItems = [
            addBarButtonItem,
            refreshBarButtonItem
        ]

        self.activatePullToReach(on: navigationItem)
    }
    
    ...
```

If your ViewController is contained in an `UINavigationController` you can activate pull-to-reach on all `UIBarButtonItems`. Selecting an item using pull-to-reach will call the same action as the normal UIBarButtonItem action so there is nothing more for you to be done.

## üñå Custom styling

#### Changing highlight color

If you want to change the highlight color, you can specify it when activating pull-to-reach.

```swift
self.activatePullToReach(on: navigationItem, highlightColor: .red)
```

#### Completely custom behavior

By overriding the `applyStyle` function you can define completely custom style. All the changes between states will be animated by default.

```swift
class ScalingButton: UIButton {

    override func applyStyle(isHighlighted: Bool, highlightColor: UIColor) {
        let scale: CGFloat = isHighlighted ? 1.5 : 1.0
        transform = CGAffineTransform(translationX: scale, y: scale)
    }

}
```

## üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage outside of NavigationBar

Pull-To-Reach can not only be activated for the navigation items, but also for every `UIControl` independently from its position or functionality. This can be very helpful when you have non-standard views with your own controls. To define your style, you can override `applyStyle` as seen above.

## üõ† Installation

#### CocoaPods

To integrate PullToReach into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, add this to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'PullToReach'
```

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

#### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the dependency managers, you can integrate PullToReach into your project manually, by downloading the source code and placing the files on your project directory.
